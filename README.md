# Healthcare System(UsingSpatio Temporal Data-Analytics)

## Project Overview:
This project involves predicting COVID-19 cases using historical data and machine learning models, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project utilizes time-series data from a publicly available COVID-19 dataset, performs preprocessing and visualization, and compares the performance of LSTM and CNN models in predicting future cases.

## Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is covid_19_india.csv. It contains daily COVID-19 data from different states and Union Territories in India. The crucial columns are:

Date, State/UnionTerritory, ConfirmedIndianNational, ConfirmedForeignNational, Cured, Deaths, Confirmed.

## Libraries Used:
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.</br>
NumPy: For numerical operations.</br>
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.</br>
Scikit-learn: For splitting data into training and testing sets, and scaling features.</br>
TensorFlow/Keras: For building LSTM and CNN models.

### Key Concepts:
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) specifically designed to model sequences and time-series data. It can capture long-term dependencies in the data and is well-suited for time-series prediction tasks.

#### CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks): CNNs are widely used in image processing but can also be applied to time-series problems. By treating time-series data as a multi-dimensional input, CNNs can capture spatial and temporal features, making them useful for certain forecasting tasks.

#### Data Preprocessing: 
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, filtering columns, and ensuring data consistency are critical steps before modeling.</br>
Feature Scaling: Standardizing the data ensures that no single feature dominates the learning process due to differing scales.

#### Model Training and Validation:
Epochs and Batch Size: Models are trained over multiple epochs with a specific batch size to gradually minimize the loss function.</br>
Loss Functions: MSE is used for regression tasks to quantify the difference between predicted and actual values.</br>
Validation: A validation split is used to monitor model performance during training and prevent overfitting.


## Steps Involved:
### Data Preprocessing:
Load the dataset using Pandas.
Convert the Date column to a datetime object.
Handle missing values by dropping rows where crucial columns contain null values.
Group the data by Date and State/UnionTerritory to prepare it for time-series analysis.
Pivot the data to create a time-series structure, with Date as the index and State/UnionTerritory as columns.

### Scaling the Data: 
Use StandardScaler from Scikit-learn to standardize the features for efficient learning by the models.
LSTM Model:The LSTM model is designed for sequential data. It takes historical data points (14 days) as input and predicts the next day's COVID-19 cases.</br>
Architecture:
Two LSTM layers with 64 units each.
Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
A Dense layer with a linear activation function for continuous output.
The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function.

### CNN Model:
The CNN model treats the problem spatially, where each state's data is treated as a "feature map."
Architecture:
A Conv2D layer followed by a MaxPooling layer.
A Flatten layer to convert the feature maps into a single vector.
A Dense layer for the final prediction.
The CNN model is also compiled with Adam optimizer and MSE loss.

### Model Evaluation and Comparison:
Both models are trained using 80% of the data, while 20% is used for testing.
Performance metrics include Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and plots comparing the actual vs. predicted COVID-19 cases for both models.

### Visualization:
Training and validation losses are plotted for both models.
A comparison plot of actual vs. predicted cases is created for both LSTM and CNN models.
